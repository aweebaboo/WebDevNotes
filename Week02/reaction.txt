 Important things to do:
 Clarify what the problem is and how you will address it
 Make sketches to help designing later
 Get early feedback to help direct development
 Use a wireframing tool you're comfortable with
 Make sure your wireframe is tailored to the audience

All these things seem useful to take into account while wireframing since if you keep these in mind you can save yourself from having to do extra work in the future.  I'll try to keep these in mind for when I start wireframing.
