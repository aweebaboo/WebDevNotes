A famous explorer and adventurer in his younger days, Cayde ran with a pack of Hunters that included Shiro-4 and Andal Brask, his predecessor as Hunter Vanguard. After Andal was murdered by Taniks, the Scarred, whom Cayde was believed to have previously killed, Cayde took up his friend's post in the Tower despite his hatred of being stuck doing paperwork and unable to go on missions.  As the Hunter Vanguard, Cayde often looked the other way or facilitated Guardians who operated outside of normal operating procedures. Despite this, he became a close friend of both his fellow Vanguards, Commander Zavala and Ikora Rey. During the Taken War he assisted The Guardian in infiltrating the Dreadnaught to defeat Oryx, the Taken King and later fought beside them on the frontlines of the Red War. His experiences in the Red War led Cayde to leave his duties in The Last City frequently to return to field missions, leading to his demise in the Prison of Elders at the hands of Uldren Sov and the Scorn Barons."

Ikora also oversees The Hidden, an extensive network of Guardians who serve as the Vanguard's secret intelligence gatherers. From her position, Ikora helped navigate The Last City's survival against numerous threats, although her secretive nature sometimes set her at odds with fellow Vanguard leaders and friends Commander Zavala and Cayde-6.  Following the Red War and the murder of Cayde, Ikora advocated for more aggressive stances against the foes of the Last City and often clashed with Zavala on matters of policy. Reuniting with her former mentor Osiris, Ikora began keeping an even greater number of secrets from Zavala while distancing herself from her duties as Vanguard to focus on managing the Hidden."

As the Prince of the Reef he served as the Master of Crows, the official spymaster of the Reef and monitored all threats to his people. While a loyal advisor to his sister, he disagreed with Mara frequently on matters of defense and foreign policy, and was very disdainful of the Guardians. During the Battle of Saturn his fighter was damaged and crashed on Mars. Over the next several years Uldren sought to find his sister, convinced she remained alive, but was corrupted and manipulated by Riven into creating the Scorn and turning on the Reef in his bid to reopen the Dreaming City. After murdering Cayde-6 during his crusade, Uldren was eventually hunted down and killed by the Young Wolf and Petra Venj. Uldren's body was found in the Dreaming City by a Ghost and revived as a Lightbearer. Traveling to Earth and naming his Ghost Glint, the new Lightbearer soon learned to hide from Guardians who grew violent when they saw his face. After one confrontation left him drifting in the vacuum of space, he was rescued by the Spider, who mockingly dubbed him as Crow and pressed him into service as an enforcer to repay his debt. Crow was freed from this servitude by the Young Wolf after helping them defeat the High Celebrant of Xivu Arath and chose to become a Guardian after receiving visions from the Traveler. Under the mentorship of the Guardian and Savathûn posing as Osiris, Crow traveled to the Last City and became a scout for the Vanguard."

During his exile, Osiris continued his research on the Vex and discovered the Infinite Forest on Mercury, which he proceeded to explore in an effort to thwart the Vex's plans for the Solar System. After being aided by The Guardian and Ikora Rey in stopping Panoptes, Infinite Mind, Osiris re-established connections with the Last City and continued exploring the Infinite Forest while seeking the means to save Saint-14 from his death within the Vex machine. After succeeding in saving his partner, Osiris departed Mercury to gather allies and information about a dark future he saw approaching the solar system.  After an encounter with an agent of Xivu Arath resulted in the death of his Ghost, Sagira, Osiris lost his connection to the Light. For a period of time, he was then possessed by Savathûn, the Witch Queen, who used his form to walk among the people of the Last City and spy on the Vanguard. He was later released by Savathûn, but remained in a coma, which he awoke from after being given a Darkness-infused brew prepared from the remains of Nezarec by Mithrax, Kell of Light. He has since continued his work with the Vanguard, though no longer taking an active combat role due to the loss of his Ghost, and most recently accompanied the Guardian to Neomuna on a mission to stop the Shadow Legion from acquiring the Veil and later assume a passive role in mentoring Guardians with the Darkness-aligned power of Strand."

After the exile of Osiris and Saint-14's crusades against the Fallen, Saint-14 disappeared on a mission to Mercury to prevent Osiris from disturbing the Vex. He was later stripped of his Light by the Vex and perished in the Infinite Forest shortly after documenting his final notes to Osiris, the Speaker, and to The Guardian. However, he was spared this fate with the time-traveling intervention of the Guardian that served as his inspiration and has since returned to the City to oversee the Trials of Osiris at his old friend's request, to prepare the City for the coming Darkness."

He can also sell legendary weapons that arrive on Armsday, if the player has earned enough reputation by testing weapons for him.  Banshee exhibits a somewhat depressed mood, but also shows a dry sense of humor. He regarded not knowing about his previous lives as a blessing, believing that he must have messed them up somehow, and had no desire to live a forty-fifth reboot. He also seems to be very forgetful, sometimes even mentioning people he has lost as though they were still alive. This is likely an unfortunate by-product of him having been rebooted so many times, as excessive memory wipes are known to degrade an Exo's mind."

Mara was the first to emerge as an Awoken in the new dimension and crafted its society for millions of years in preparation for returning to the Sol System to help those left behind. Once returned, Mara established a kingdom amongst the asteroid belt and began gathering powerful allies and pawns to her side, including her brother Prince Uldren Sov, her lover and Wrath Sjur Eido, the Ahamkara Riven, and the rogue Guardians Eris Morn and Osiris.  Keeping an aloof and enigmatic demeanor to belie a ruthless nature, Mara was not above helping others for a price and gathered knowledge regarding many secrets, including how to enter the Black Garden. She defeated many threats before they reached the remnants of humanity on Earth in The Last City, all to prepare for a confrontation with her nemesis Savathûn. During the Taken War Mara disappeared following the Battle of Saturn in a bid to usurp Oryx's power and returned to the Dreaming City years later to fight a curse laid upon it. She departed once more with Eris to fight the Witness and its servants before it reached the Sol System, ultimately returning once more after she failed to prevent the Black Fleet's arrival.

She is driven to understand the deepest secrets of the universe and gains power from the deception and confusion of those who seek to understand her unfathomable schemes.  However, her true goals were revealed to undermine the Witness and its goals of realizing the Final Shape, working her own secretive agenda from the inside to prevent humanity's extinction during the Collapse and to protect and preserve the Traveler at all costs.

Following this encounter where his life would be spared by The Guardian, Mithrax abandoned House Dusk and began to trust Guardians further. Working with two Guardians in a fireteam, he would eventually come to return the favor and provided key information to the Last City which prevented the heist of Zero Hour. These actions inadvertently caused Eramis, the Shipstealer to create the House of Salvation in the wake of her loss.  Later, Ikora sought the aid of Mithrax to end the Endless Night created by the Vex. It was revealed that he is a Sacred Splicer who has the ability to breach the Vex network by refocusing Light. After aiding the Vanguard in the defeat of Quria, Blade Transform and stopping the Endless Night, he became a staunch ally of the Vanguard with his House taking up permanent residence in the Last City's Botza district.
